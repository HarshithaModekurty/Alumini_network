![alt text](image-1.png)
## Vision

The **AlumniNetworkDAO** aims to create a decentralized platform where alumni can propose, vote on, and execute initiatives that benefit their network. The contract empowers members to drive positive change within the alumni community, streamline decision-making processes, and track the progress of various initiatives through a transparent and automated system.

## Project Features

- **Propose Initiatives:** Members can propose new initiatives to improve or engage the alumni network.
- **Vote on Initiatives:** Members can vote on proposed initiatives to express their support or opposition.
- **Execute Initiatives:** Initiatives with sufficient votes can be executed, indicating the community's endorsement.
- **View Initiative Details:** Members can view details of any initiative, including its title, description, vote count, and execution status.

## Future Scope

- **Multi-Signature Voting:** Implement a multi-signature requirement for executing initiatives to enhance security.
- **Quorum Requirement:** Introduce a quorum requirement to ensure a minimum number of votes are cast before an initiative can be executed.
- **Governance Tokens:** Integrate a token-based voting system to allocate voting power based on token holdings.
- **Enhanced Reporting:** Develop additional features to generate reports and statistics on initiatives and voting patterns.
- **Integration with Web3 Applications:** Create a frontend interface to interact with the smart contract via Web3 technologies for better user experience.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Smart Contract Code:**
   - **`AlumniNetworkDAO.sol`:** The main Solidity contract implementing the DAO functionality.

2. **Contract Features:**
   - **Structs:**
     - `Initiative`: Represents an initiative with details such as ID, title, description, vote count, and execution status.
   - **State Variables:**
     - `nextInitiativeId`: Tracks the ID of the next initiative to be proposed.
     - `initiatives`: A mapping from initiative IDs to their corresponding `Initiative` struct.
   - **Events:**
     - `InitiativeProposed`: Emitted when a new initiative is proposed.
     - `VoteCasted`: Emitted when a vote is cast for an initiative.
     - `InitiativeExecuted`: Emitted when an initiative is executed.
   - **Functions:**
     - `proposeInitiative(string memory _title, string memory _description)`: Allows members to propose a new initiative.
     - `voteForInitiative(uint _initiativeId)`: Allows members to vote for an existing initiative.
     - `executeInitiative(uint _initiativeId)`: Executes an initiative if it has enough votes.
     - `getInitiativeDetails(uint _initiativeId)`: Retrieves details of an initiative.
